# ANP
The acronym ANP stands for Animated Nyquist Plot and is a function written in Matlab.

It draws display rational transfer functions as a customizable Nyquist plot. The GUI shows the contribution of every pole and zero to the plots magnitude and phase. It allows the user to gain deeper knowledge about what happens in the origin by choosing how large the radius of the D-contour should be.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

ANP has been developed in Matlab R2016b. It should be backward compatible down to R2016a. R2017a hasn't been tested, yet.

(v4.0 should be compatible down to R2014b.)

You'll need to have the following toolboxes installed:
* Control Toolbox
* Optimization Toolbox

### Installing

Download the project by clicking 'Clone or download' button in the upper right and then choose ZIP.

Unzip the contents to your desired Matlab workspace folder.
You don't need the folders 'additional' and 'archive' for the function to work.

### Usage examples

Open 'anp_usage_examples.m' with Matlab and execute the sample statements by highlighting line by line and hitting F9.
